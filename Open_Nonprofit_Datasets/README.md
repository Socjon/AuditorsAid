## Johns Hopkins Nonprofit Works Project 

"The Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies' Nonprofit Economic Data project (NED) has found a way to draw on a previously untapped source of data generated through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). For 15 years, the NED has been producing cutting-edge reports on the size, composition, distribution, and growth of nonprofit employment in regions and states across the country and the U.S. as a whole drawing on this unparalleled--but previously untapped--source of data on nonprofit employment. To accomplish this, the Center pioneered a procedure for identifying nonprofit institutions (NPIs) in the BLS database and secured BLS cooperation to extract the resulting data on NPIs in aggregated form from the hundreds of records in the QCEW dataset. These reports have been instrumental in demonstrating the nonprofit sector's important role as a powerful economic engine and identifying key nonprofit trends such as the striking pattern of nonprofit employment growth and the suburbanization of nonprofit operations. States and localities have used our data to advocate for the sector and to educate policymakers and the public about the sector's vital role not only as a program and service provider, but also as a major employer and growing industry."

"Data are currently available at the state and county level for the years 1990-2011. National data are available for 2007-2011. Please see the [Methodology](http://ccss.jhu.edu/nonprofit-works/about/methodology.php) page for more information on data sources and limitations."
